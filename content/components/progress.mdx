The Progress Bar component in React is used to visually indicate the completion rate of a task, such as data loading, file uploads, or any ongoing process. It can be customized with different colors, sizes, and styles to match the design of the application. Often used as a loader, it enhances user experience by providing real-time feedback. Its responsive design ensures it works across all devices, and it can be easily integrated into forms, dashboards, or content-heavy applications to show progress dynamically.
